This is for My Custome Theme so that i can use it directly.

i will use this archieve file and extract this in the ```~/.themes``` directory and [Theme Structer](images/1_theme_structer.png) will look like.


First i need to run the command to make a ```~/.themes``` This directory and need to extract the [archieve file](Mint-Y-Dark-Customized-Rana-Universe.tar.gz) to ```~/.themes``` directory which will allow to show the theme correctly.


These will looks like, [install_theme.sh](install_theme.sh) also with ```chmod +x install_theme.sh
```
